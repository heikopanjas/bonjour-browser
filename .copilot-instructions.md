## Project Overview

This is a macOS application written in Swift that provides a Bonjour service browser. The application allows users to discover and browse network services using the Bonjour/mDNS protocol.

## Key Components

1. **BonjourBrowser.swift** - The main browser class that handles service discovery using Apple's Network framework
2. **ViewController.swift** - The main UI controller with an outline view for displaying discovered services and a search/filter field
3. **ServiceNode.swift** - Data model representing discovered services in a hierarchical structure
4. **ServiceTypeBrowser.swift** - Handles discovery of available service types
5. **ServiceResolutionDelegate.swift** - Manages service resolution to get detailed information
6. **TXTRecordDelegate.swift** - Handles TXT record parsing for service metadata

## Architecture

- Uses Apple's modern Network framework (NWBrowser) for service discovery
- Implements a hierarchical view of services organized by service type
- Supports both TCP and UDP service discovery
- Includes peer-to-peer service discovery
- Features real-time filtering of discovered services

## Development Guidelines

- This is a macOS-only application (Cocoa framework)
- Uses modern Swift networking APIs
- Follows MVC pattern with clear separation of concerns
- Implements proper memory management with weak references to avoid retain cycles
- Uses delegation pattern for handling network events

## Key Features

- Automatic discovery of all Bonjour service types on the network
- Real-time service browsing with live updates
- Filterable service list
- Detailed service information display
- Support for both standard and peer-to-peer services
